  <h3>Scope in JavaScript</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Block Scope:</strong> Variables declared inside a pair of curly
      braces cannot be accessed from outside the block.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Function Scope:</strong> Variables declared inside a function
      cannot be accessed from outside the function.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Global Scope:</strong> Globally scoped variables can be accessed
      inside a block or function.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Nested Function Scope ( Lexical Scope)</strong></li>
    <li>
      <strong>Closures:</strong> A closure is the combination of a function
      bundled together with references to its surrounding state. Closures are
      created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
    </li>
    <li>
      In JavaScript, when we return a function from another function, we are
      effectively returning a combination of the function definition along with
      the function's scope. This would let the function definition have an
      associated persistent memory which could hold on to live data between
      executions. That combination of the function and its scope chain is what
      is called a closure in JavaScript.

      <h3>Function Currying</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <code>Currying</code> is a process in functional programming in which
          we transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of
          nesting functions that take one argument at a time.
        </li>
        <li>function f(a, b, c) is transfomred to f(a)(b)(c)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3><code><em>this</code></em> Keyword</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The JavaScript <code><em>'this'</em></code> keyword which is used in a function, refers to the object it belongs to. value.</li>
      <li>It makes functions reusable by letting you decide the object.</li>
      <li>The value of <code><em>this</em></code> is determined by how a function is called.</li>
      <li>
      <h4>How to determine 'this' ?</h4>

      <h3>Iterables and Iterators - Why</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Iteration in JavaScript</strong></li>
        <li><code>for...loops</code> : Problems</li>
        <li>Difficulty in accessing the element.</li>
        <li>Difficulty to manage iteration on the data for various types of data structures.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution: </strong></li>
        <li><code>for...of loops</code></li>
        <li>There was a need to iterate over various data structures in a new way that abstracts away the complexity of accessing elements one by one and was at the same time uniform across the different data structures.</li>
        <li>An object which implements the iterable protocol is called an iterable.</li>
        <li>For an object to be an iterable it must implement a method at the key [Symbol.iterator].</li>
        <li>That method should not accept any argument and should return an object which conforms to the iterator protocol.</li>
        <li>The iterator protocol decides whether an object is an iterator.</li>
        <li><p>The object must have a <code>next()</code> method that returns an object with two properties.</p>
          <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>value: which gives the current element.</li>
            <li>done: which is a boolean value indicating whether or not there are any more elements that could be iterated upon.</li>
          </ol>        
        </li>
